Known issues
------------

We are aware of a few issues that can affect the user experience. By explaining the issues here, we hope you will be able to circumvent them until they are fixed.

Risk of losing changes
""""""""""""""""""""""

If you edit content on a page, these actions will reload the page without saving your changes:

    * Adding a new content element by dragging and dropping it.
    * Hiding or unhiding a content element on the page.

*Suggested solution:* Save your changes first.
