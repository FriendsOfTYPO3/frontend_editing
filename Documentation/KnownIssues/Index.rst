Risk of losing changes
""""""""""""""""""""""

If you edit content on a page, these actions will reload the page without saving your changes:

    * Adding a new content element by dragging and dropping it.
    * Hiding or unhiding a content element on the page.

*Suggested solution:* Save your changes first.
