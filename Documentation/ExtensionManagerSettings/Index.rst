Features
========

Enable placeholders and direct drop-to-edit without modal
---------------------------------------------------------

By enabling this feature, empty editable content areas will appear with placeholders. Content elements will also appear directly after you have dropped them on the page, skipping the modal pop-up with a backend form that would otherwise appear.

When using this feature, you should adapt your templates to show empty fields using the :ref:`_viewhelpers-isplaceholderenabled` view helper.
