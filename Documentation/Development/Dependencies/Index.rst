Dependencies
============

We rely on node.js for a lot of our tooling. Go to http://nodejs.org/ and install it.

To install the tooling dependencies, run:

::

   npm install

Composer must also be installed. Download and install it from https://getcomposer.org/, then install the Composer dependencies:

::

   composer install
