Javascript
==================

.. _javascriptdev-logger:

Logger
------
The `ulog` logging framework is used to handle logs. It is a highly configurable
and extendable logger.

Persist log record on Typo3 server is not implemented yet.

Loggers available:

* `FEditing:Component:LoadingScreen`
* `FEditing:Component:Widget:Notification`
* `FEditing:CRUD`
* `FEditing:Editor`
* `FEditing:FrontendEditing`
* `FEditing:GUI`
* `FEditing:localStorage`
* `FEditing:Utils:Scroller`
* `FEditing:Utils:TranslatorFactory`
* `FEditing:Utils:TranslatorLoader`


.. _javascriptdev-logger-level:

Log Levels
----------

Following log levels exists:

* `error` : Used if an exception occured and the normal handling failed.
* `warn`: Also used if an exception occured, but the normal handling can be
  done.
* `info`: Used if an state change occured like an event (eg. mouse click)
* `log`: Used if an point of interesse is reached like the an array to loop.
* `debug`: Used if an calculation happend.
* `trace` (Not implemented yet): Used if an function get called and end.
  Only useful to record the call chains.

There are some special log levels only used to configure ulog:

* `none`: No logs get selected
* `all`: Normaly it is like `trace`. But if `ulog` log levels get extended it
  is much more save to use `all`.

**Hint:** The log level during log selection in configuration are chained. Use
`warn` log level does indirectly also select `error` logs.


.. _javascriptdev-logger-config:

Configuration
-------------

Configuration can be done as URL parameter or/and as localStorage item.
There are follwing configuration options:

* `log`: The main setting to control loggerâ€™s levels with
* `log_output`: To configure the output of the `output` channel, where
  logging should go
* `log_drain`: To configure the output of the `drain` channel

More details can be found at: https://ulog.js.org/#configure


.. _javascriptdev-logger-config-syntax:

Syntax
------

`<config_option> = <config> [; <config>] ...`
Configuration options can have more than one configuration entry:

`<config> := [ <filter> = ] <value>`
Configuration entry have a value and a filter to select the loggers to apply the config:
**Hint:** If no filter or a wildcard is set, the config is used as default config.

`<filter> := <RegEx> [ , [ - ] <RegEx> ] ...`
The filter is a list of RegEx with option to add or substract loggers from the selection set:

.. attention::

   * in `log` the `<value>` is a log level
   * in `log_<channel_name>` the `<value>` is one or more `output`


.. _javascriptdev-logger-config-example:

Examples
--------

With URL parameters:

* to log in general info level: `?log=info` (Technically, this is equals to:
  `?log=*=info`.)
* To log widgets in debug and the rest in info mode:
  `?log=info;FEditing:Component:Widget:*=debug`
* To print and persist log in output channel: `?log_ouput=console persist`
* To print logs in general and persist logs from widgets in output channel:
  `?log_ouput=console;FEditing:Component:Widget:*=console persist`
* To print logs in general and only persist logs from widgets in output
  channel: `?log_ouput=console;FEditing:Component:Widget:*=persist`


.. _javascriptdev-logger-output:

Output
------

By default there are two outputs:

* `console`: default browser `console`
* `noop`: No operation function, used to prevent log in `drain` channel


.. _javascriptdev-logger-channel:

Channel
-------

By default there are two channels:

* `output`: Used if `log` configuration is matching. eg. `log=info` and
  `logRecord.level` is smaller than info.
* `drain`: Opposite to `output` channel. Used to have the opportunity to
  handle this log records to like persist in indexedDB.


.. _javascriptdev-logger-extension:

Extensions
----------

There are two extensions as AMD available to use:

* `TYPO3/CMS/FrontendEditing/Utils/LoggerPersist`
  Add two output `Persist`, `Server` and a new channel `highorder`
* `TYPO3/CMS/FrontendEditing/Utils/LoggerWindowError`
  Register window error handlers to log them with a logger.


.. _javascriptdev-logger-extension-highorder:

`highorder` channel
-------------------

There are two new configuration options:

* `highorder_log`: The main setting to control `highorder` channel selection.
  *Hint:* Analog to the `log` option and the `output` channel
* `log_highorder`: To configure the output of the `highorder` channel, where
  logging should go
