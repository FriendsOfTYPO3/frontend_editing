============

Required steps
==============

The following steps are required to use frontend editing in a TYPO3 installation.

*  Install the extension

   #. **Using Composer** (recommended):

      .. code-block:: bash

         composer req friendsoftypo3/frontend-editing

      or by downloading the extension.

   #. **Using the Extension Manager** in *Admin Tools > Extensions* as explained

Optional steps
==============

* Set the baseUrl for frontend editing if server path is not a top directory. This is done by adding the following part to setup typoscript:

  .. code-block:: typoscript

     plugin.tx_frontendediting.baseUrl = /

* Include the static template *Editable Fluid Styled Content v11*, to include basic editable templates for Fluid Styled Content in TYPO3 v11.

* Disable the :ref:`placeholder feature <extension-manager-settings-features>` in the extension configuration. By disabling this feature, empty editable content areas will no longer with placeholders. When creating a new content element by dragging and dropping onto the page, a modal pop-up with a backend form will appear so that you can fill in the initial content.
