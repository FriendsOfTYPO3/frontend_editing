About this extension
--------------------

This package adds frontend editing capability to TYPO3 CMS, using `CKEditor <http://ckeditor.com/>`__, the rich text editor used by the TYPO3 core. The editor appears as a new backend module. When selecting a page in the page tree, the page becomes editable. Editable regions are configured in the templates, using Fluid or TypoScript.
