    <h1>Welcome to Storybook for HTML</h1>
    <p>This is a UI component dev environment for your plain HTML snippets.</p>
    <p>
        We've added some basic stories inside the <code class="code">stories</code> directory.
        <br />
        A story is a single state of one or more UI components. You can have as many stories as you want.
        <br />
        (Basically a story is like a visual test case.)
    </p>
    <p>
        See these sample <a class="link" href="#" data-sb-kind="Demo" data-sb-story="button">stories</a>
    </p>
    <!--<p><img src=logo.svg class="logo" /></p>-->
    <p>
        Just like that, you can add your own snippets as stories.
        <br />
        You can also edit those snippets and see changes right away.
        <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        Usually we create stories with smaller UI components in the app.<br />
        Have a look at the

            Writing Stories
