# Introduction

There is following base structure:

* Design
* Elements
* Utils

## Design

This package contains stories of simple html constructs combined with CSS. There
are 2 kind of server generated templates:
* FLUID based templates which are extendable by TYPO3 configuration
* Functional based templates which get created by parameters

FLUID generated HTML gets saved as HTML fragments in a per component separated 
folder and sub folders. They only needed to be in this folder to be usable.

Functional based templates are reproduced as react components.

## Elements

This package contains elements with representation on HTML like controllers.

## Utils

This package contains utils function without an own HTML representation.
Much work for testing cause of need to write an fully functional mock as wrapper.
